This example demonstrates a common error in Kotlin involving ConcurrentModificationException.  When iterating and modifying a mutable map (or other concurrent collections) simultaneously, a ConcurrentModificationException can be thrown. This is because the iterator's internal state becomes invalidated when the collection is structurally modified during iteration.  The solution shows how to safely remove elements using iterators or other collection functions.
